        >
        Born in Naples, Italy, into a wealthy Genevan family, Victor and his
        younger brothers, Ernest and William, are sons of Alphonse Frankenstein
        and the former Caroline Beaufort. From a young age, Victor has a strong
        desire to understand the world. He is obsessed with studying theories of
        alchemists, though when he is older he realizes that such theories are
        considerably outdated. When Victor is five years old, his parents adopt
        Elizabeth Lavenza, the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian
        nobleman, whom Victor later marries. Victor's parents later take in
        another child, Justine Moritz, who becomes William's nanny. Weeks before
        he leaves for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany, his mother dies
        of scarlet fever; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with
        the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences,
        soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter.
        He undertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in
        replicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the
        Creature tall, about 8 feet (2.4 m) in height, and proportionally large.
        Despite Victor's selecting its features to be beautiful, upon animation
        the Creature is instead hideous, with watery white eyes and yellow skin
        that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed
        by his work, Victor flees. While wandering the streets the next day, he
        meets his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, and takes Henry back to his
        apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if he sees the monster. However,
        when Victor returns to his laboratory, the Creature is gone. Victor
        falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry.
        After a four-month recovery, he receives a letter from his father
        notifying him of the murder of his brother William. Upon arriving in
        Geneva, Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and becomes
        convinced that his creation is responsible. Justine Moritz, William's
        nanny, is convicted of the crime after William's locket, which contained
        a miniature portrait of Caroline, is found in her pocket. Victor knows
        that no one will believe him if he tries to clear Justine's name, and
        she is hanged. Ravaged by grief and guilt, Victor retreats into the
        mountains. While he hikes through Mont Blanc's Mer de Glace, he is
        suddenly approached by the Creature, who pleads for Victor to hear his
        tale.
